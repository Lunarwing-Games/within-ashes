![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built_with-Python-blue?logo=python&logoColor=%23FFFFFF)

*Within Ashes* is a surivial roguelike with aspects of resource management. The main goal is to explore the area you're in and survive as long as possible while staying sane, healthy, and in one piece. *Within Ashes* takes place in a partially reclaimed city, in the future after some catastrophic event lead to the destruction of the city. Within the boundaries of this former city you can find an array of buildings to freely explore for resources to keep yourself alive and defended.

You can choose where to survive, when the game first starts. Some areas are harder than others and have differing benefits overall.

## Why C++

C++ is *the* industry standard for high-performance programming. Early commits show this project being built in Python, however due to complexities in how Python's Pygame-CE handles OpenGL/SDL and how Steamworks handle it, all the original source code was removed and being re-written for C++ once again. Keeping everything unified is the better move overall despite the slowdown in iteration.
